# README

This is a personal project to build up my understanding of Ruby on Rails.

I will be making a website for my gf to show off arts and craft and allow this site to function as a 'virtual business card'.

# Ideas

1. Allow users to sign up for an account.

2. Users can reset their password through an email link.

3. Users can comment on posts of crafts.

4. Users can see post history of their comments and other user comment histories.

# Credits

I'm unsure if any free images/icons will be in the final project, but I will of course credit the website and creator until then.
